-- | 'ImplicitOps' gives computations access to mect operations of an
-- operation through implicit parameter constraints. It hides the machinery
-- of implicit parameters and make them appear like regular constraints except
-- with local scope.
--
-- The law for 'ImplicitOps' is
--
-- @
-- forall ops . 'withOps' ops 'captureOps' === ops
-- @
--
-- This means any non-trivial instance for 'ImplicitOps' must somehow make use of
-- implicit parameters for the law to hold.
--
-- The definition for 'ImplicitOps' for most mect operations can typically
-- be derived mechanically. We may look into using template Haskell to generate
-- instances for 'ImplicitOps' in future to reduce some boilerplate.
