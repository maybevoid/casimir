-- | An opaque object-ish effect lifter that can apply 'effmap' to an 'EffFunctor'.
-- We define dedicated datatype instead of using the natural transformation
-- @(~>)@ so that in the case of identity, we can construct a special 'idLift'
-- that skip calling @'effmap' id@ and return the original 'EffFunctor'. This may
-- save a bit on creating redundant
-- 'Control.Effect.Implicit.Base.Operation' and
-- 'Control.Effect.Implicit.Base.CoOperation' objects during @'effmap' id@,
-- particularly when they are used together with
-- 'Control.Effect.Implicit.Computation.Computation'.

    liftEff :: forall x . eff1 x -> eff2 x,

    -- | When applying effect lifting to an 'EffFunctor', 'applyEffmap' should
    -- be used instead of calling 'effmap' directly. This could potentially
    -- save some unnecesssary objects recreation in the case of 'idLift'.

    -- @
    --   'joinLift' idLift idLift === idLift
    --   'joinLift' idLift lift2 === lift2
    --   'joinLift' lift1 idLift === lift1

-- | Create a 'LiftEff' from a natural transformation @eff1 ~> eff2@. This assumes
-- @eff1@ and @eff2@ are different, as otherwise we can use 'idLift' for optimized
-- version of 'LiftEff'.
