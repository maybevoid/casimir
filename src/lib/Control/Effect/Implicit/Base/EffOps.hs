-- | An effect operation must also be an instance of 'EffOps' to give
-- computations access to @'Operation' ops@ through implicit parameter
-- constraints. The 'FreeOps' class hides the machinery of implicit
-- parameters and make them appear like regular constraints with local
-- scope. The definition for 'EffOps' for most effect operations can
-- typically be derived mechanically. We may look into using template
-- Haskell to generate instances for 'EffOps' in future to reduce the
-- boilerplate.
--
-- The law for 'EffOps' is
--
-- @
-- forall ops . 'withOps' ops 'captureOps' === ops
-- @
--
-- This means any non-trivial instance for 'EffOps' must somehow make use of
-- implicit parameters for the law to hold.

  -- @type OpsConstraint FooEff eff = (?fooOps :: Operation FooEff eff)@.

  -- implicit parameters have a single namespace, users must come out with
  -- naming conventions for their custom effects to avoid name clashing
  -- that would result in compile-time injectivity violation error.
